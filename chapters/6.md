# Chapter 6: Writing code

Here is where we will start writing the actual code for our tweak. It is important to start small; it is the easiest way to learn and can be used to build more complicated tweaks once you get the hang of Objective-C and Theos. When creating a tweak, think of something you want to change. For our test tweak, we will start by hiding the background of the Dock.

I have mentioned the idea of classes a few times before. A class acts like a template, and can have properties that can be modified without affecting its parent class. In Objective-C and iOS, a class followed by a ```: OtherClass``` means its properties are inherited from ```OtherClass```. iOS uses the framework **UIKit** for all of the views displayed on the screen. This means that the base class ```UIView``` is the parent of most views. We can assume that any class that begins with UI is inherited from UIView and we can use its methods and properties without declaring them ourselves. 

To find which class to hook, I suggest downloading the tweak [Flexing](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.pantsthief.flexing/). To use this tweak, hold down on the Status Bar and a menu will appear. Click the arrow in the center and select the Dock. It may not appear in the list immediately so use the search bar to look for it

```objective-c
@interface UIView
- (void)setBackgroundColor:(UIColor *)backgroundColor;
@end

@interface OurClass: UIView
@end
```

Here we can see that the class OurClass is inherited from UIView. This means that the method ```- (void)setBackgroundColor:(UIColor *)backgroundColor;``` can be used by our class automatically. 

Before we get too ahead of ourselves, we should talk about Objective-C class declarations, methods, properties and instance variables. 

A method is a piece of code that can be called and runs code inside of it. The code above sets the background color of a view. Classes have properties and instance variables. Below is an example of the class SBDockView which managest the Dock on your homescreen.

```objective-c
@interface SBDockView : UIView {
    UIView* _backgroundView;
}
@property (nonatomic, retain) UIView * backgroundView;  
@end
```

The piece between the ```{}``` is an instance variable or ivar for short. These can be modified using MSHookIvar. Under this we can see a ```@property```. This may seem redundant, but it is what allows us to access this variable. We can see that the ivar has a type of ```UIView```. This means if we want to hide the background of the Dock, we just need to hide this ivar. Lets hook ```SBDockView``` by adding this to our Tweak.xm. Notice we declared or put the interface of the class at the top of the file.

There are a multitude of ways with which we can hide our background. Each UIView has a few methods we can override to use. A common mistake is to use the method ```- (void)layoutSubviews``` as it exists on all UIViews, but this is where we must be smart. This is called many times, whenever the view changes. Adding code to this could cause it to be run many times as well, and could cause memory leaks and unwanted resprings. Most of the time you will be safe, but I **highly** suggest using other methods such as ```- (void)didMoveToWindow;``` as this is called once.

Next we must talk about ```%orig;``` and ```orig();```. This is a part of Logos that runs the code that Apple originally put inside a method. For instance in our ```- (void)didMoveToWindow {}``` we must add an ```%orig;``` in order for our Dock to function properly. Any code added after ```%orig;``` will be run after the original function. 

We will hide our background view using ```MSHookIvar``` in the next chapter
